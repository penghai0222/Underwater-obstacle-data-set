Description of the Underwater obstacles Dataset
1. Dataset Overview
This dataset comprises 2,600 images of underwater obstacles along with their corresponding labels, aimed at supporting research in image recognition and analysis within underwater environments. The dataset has been organized according to the divisions outlined in the associated paper, including training, validation, and testing sets. The obstacles are categorized into four distinct classes based on their shapes: globosity，cuboid，irregularity，cylinder.
2. Dataset Structure
The dataset comprises the following components:
• image/train/: Contains images for the training set.
• images/val/: Contains images for the validation set.
• image/test/: Contains images for the test set.
• labels/train/: Corresponding labels for the training set images.
• labels/val/: Corresponding labels for the validation set images.
• labels/test/: Corresponding labels for the test set images.
The label files are stored in a text format, detailing information such as object categories and locations within the images.
3. Dataset Partitioning
The dataset has been partitioned according to the following proportions:
• Training set: 1,560 images.
• Validation set: 520 images.
• Test set: 520 images.
This partitioning approach is designed to ensure the diversity and balance of the dataset, making it suitable for research tasks such as image classification and object detection.
4. User Instructions 
To facilitate data analysis and model training, all image and label files are saved in a standardized format. Users can directly download the dataset and utilize it according to their specific needs.
